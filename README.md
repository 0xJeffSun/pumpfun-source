# pumpfun-source

Reconstructed Rust source for Pump.fun's Solana programs, with captured binaries,
reproducible builds and local differential tests.

**Progress as of 27 October 2026: all four core programs still differ from their
captured binaries. The selected Donation Relay reconstruction reproduces its complete meaningful
ELF and, through a separate loader deployment, its captured payload.**

## Current progress

[Current main-Pump parallel research snapshot](research/main-pump-parallel-checkpoint-20261027/README.md) preserves the verified intermediates and in-progress source beyond the maintained checkpoint.

**Main Pump: 69.9% of function windows matched; 49.5% of original text covered. Complete reconstruction remains unfinished.**

Across the latest verified checkpoints, **2,862 / 3,338 inferred function windows
match (85.7%)**. Their matched windows cover **3,767,552 / 5,213,128 original text
bytes (72.3%)**. **One of five programs has complete meaningful-ELF identity**;
all four core contracts still differ from their captured binaries.

These percentages measure bounded binary-recovery progress, not a claim that
85.7% of the engineering work is finished. Complete reconstruction also requires
all remaining code, calls, data, relocations and build provenance.

| Latest verified checkpoint | Matched windows | Matched % | Raw-equal bodies | Normalized only | Unmatched | Whole ELF equal |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| [Pump Round27](repro/pump/main-contract-round27-20261027/README.md) | 723 / 1,035 | 69.9% | 123 | 600 | 312 | No |
| [PumpSwap / AMM](repro/pump_amm/guard-data-recovery-20261027/README.md) | 638 / 785 | 81.3% | 128 | 510 | 147 | No |
| [Fees research](research/fees-withdraw-tuple-integration/README.md) | 580 / 585 | 99.1% | 198 | 382 | 5 | No |
| [Mayhem research](research/mayhem-sizing-panic-recovery/README.md) | 429 / 441 | 97.3% | 100 | 329 | 12 | No |
| [Donation Relay](repro/donation-relay/canonical-exact-selection/README.md) | 492 / 492 | 100.0% | 492 | 0 | 0 | **Yes** |

“Windows” are inferred original machine-function ranges, including framework and
runtime helpers. Complete normalized matches mask specified call/address
operands; they do not prove the referenced callees or data match. Each original
window counts once. Raw equality means that local body is byte-equal, not that
the whole program is identical.

| Checkpoint | Text bytes in matched windows | Text covered | Unmatched text |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Pump Round27 | 886,312 / 1,792,208 | 49.5% | 905,896 |
| PumpSwap / AMM | 782,776 / 1,162,040 | 67.4% | 379,264 |
| Fees research | 750,520 / 799,648 | 93.9% | 49,128 |
| Mayhem research | 595,456 / 706,744 | 84.3% | 111,288 |
| Donation Relay | 752,488 / 752,488 | 100.0% | 0 |
| **Total** | **3,767,552 / 5,213,128** | **72.3%** | **1,445,576** |

Pump and AMM rows describe the verified maintained sources. Fees and Mayhem rows
are the latest upstream research frontiers, distinct from their maintained
selections in [repro/status.json](repro/status.json). The maintained Mayhem initializer now has its own [current-source build and
signed validation](repro/mayhem/initializer-current-20261027/README.md), separate
from the larger research frontier. Upstream Relay's canonical selection remains
the authority for its exact result.

Relay reproduces all **818,280 meaningful ELF bytes**. Its separate signed local
loader replay reproduces the **830,448-byte captured payload**, including 12,168
loader-allocated zero bytes. This does not establish the original historical
source or build recipe.

The latest [Metaplex research packet](research/claude-deps-metaplex-20261027/README.md)
matches all 707,448 bytes of the captured meaningful ELF and all 1,251 function
windows. A separate 86,543-byte zero extension matches the captured allocation;
it is not part of the stripped compiler artifact. This dependency result remains
unpromoted and does not change the core-program totals above. The [parallel-lane
review](research/claude-lanes-review-20261027/README.md) records the other packets
and their baseline/validation limits.
The [independent Utilize recovery](research/metaplex-utilize-exact-recovery/README.md)
adds the retained unstripped compiler output, empty-target build/dependency
receipts and two separately signed replays of that same 147-case corpus. Its
alternative source is an unpromoted compiler-context diagnostic.

## Behavior and remaining work

Pump Round27 passes 10,468 full cases plus 6,502 focused executions, with 16,966
paired diagnostic-log cases. AMM passes 17,462 full cases plus the separate
account, fee, CPI, boundary and error-order matrices recorded in its checkpoint.
These corpora overlap and must not be summed as unique scenarios. Tests use
captured programs in local VMs; they do not establish current-chain acceptance.

The latest [Mayhem trade-origin and validator recovery](research/mayhem-trade-origins-validator/README.md)
adds the complete 1,296-byte normalized quote validator with its eight immediate
callees and fourteen typed data references checked. It reaches 429 normalized
and retains all 100 raw matches. Three partial trade handlers now reproduce 21
Source records and three CPI error origins. Two qualified builds agree, and 65
fresh case pairs pass. Twelve bodies, a required allocator specialization and
whole-ELF identity remain unresolved; older runtime receipts keep their original
artifact bindings.

The [BuyV2 sizing follow-up](research/mayhem-sizing-panic-recovery/README.md)
preserves that frontier and restores the original typed sizing failure for all
three quote families. Its 6,636 fresh trade comparisons agree in functional
results and complete non-compute logs. The BuyV2 body remains unmatched.

A [same-IR compiler diagnostic](research/mayhem-host-llvm-comparison/README.md)
produces identical Mac and Linux LLVM objects for one earlier initializer
control. This narrows that investigation without adding a function match.

An [allocator-context experiment](research/mayhem-allocator-context/README.md)
reproduces the missing reserve helper through a zeroed-allocation probe. It
identifies a compiler condition to recover through justified source; the probe
remains a diagnostic and the current reconstruction counts are unchanged.

The [historical parser follow-up](research/mayhem-allocator-parser-provenance/README.md)
reproduces that allocator form with an earlier Anchor event-parser template and
current event types. It is a mixed-source compiler experiment; original Mayhem
source remains unproven. The [current-source composition](research/mayhem-control-work-20261027/README.md)
now preserves all 429 normalized matches and reaches 139 raw-local bodies,
with one additional matching allocator call. Repeated native builds agree;
6,636 fresh trade and 69 initializer comparisons pass. Its 39 additional raw
bodies cover 33,968 original text bytes. This remains a diagnostic, so the
established checkpoint counts in the table above are unchanged.

The [current-source historical macro composition](research/mayhem-historical-macro-current-20261027/README.md)
reproduces that same artifact with the complete historical Anchor macro and
historical event definition, removing the manually rendered parser. Two native
root builds agree; the upstream-gated control reproduces the parent. The target
runtime is still current Anchor, and no new original matches or target executions
are claimed.

The latest [Fees Withdraw integration](research/fees-withdraw-tuple-integration/README.md)
composes the published tuple-ownership source with the current Social recovery
and linker layout. The recovered 967-instruction handler raises Fees to 580
normalized / 198 raw-local matches. All 21,079 readonly bytes and the program-ID
fixes are preserved. Two native builds agree and all 17,331 fresh comparisons
pass. Five functions, absolute layout and complete ELF identity remain unresolved.

The [Fees continuation archive](research/fees-work-continuation-20261027/README.md)
preserves 12,520 new or updated research files beyond the earlier work checkpoint.
These experiments retain their individual status and add no accepted matches.

The latest [PumpSwap guard, route and data recovery](repro/pump_amm/guard-data-recovery-20261027/README.md) adds 15 matching windows, closes the canonical-pool and route-lookahead ordering gaps, and restores accumulator descriptor paths. All 17,462 corpus cases and expanded signed probes pass; 147 AMM windows remain. A separate malformed-recipient follow-up still differs in six of nine cases and remains open.

Remaining priorities are the 312 Pump, 147 AMM, 5 Fees and 12 Mayhem unmatched
windows; deeper call/data/relocation identity; original build provenance; and
uncovered behavior such as authentic fixed-admin AMM `create_config` success.
The historical [150-handler audit](repro/reconstruction-audit-2026-10-26/handlers.md)
remains a separate bounded classification; newer function matches do not
retroactively certify every handler.
