# pumpfun-source

Deployment evidence and reconstruction tooling for the official Pump.fun Solana
programs. **Byte-for-byte source reconstruction is not complete.** Experimental executables now contain recovered handlers with pinned candidate build recipes,
but the implementations remain partial and all whole-program comparisons differ.

Verified captures include Pump, PumpSwap, Pump Fees and Mayhem, plus five separately
deployed dependencies. Each capture preserves the entire account payload, including
allocation padding, with SHA-256, finalized observation slots and available loader
metadata. See [scope and hashes](docs/SCOPE.md).

A partial Rust fee-tier selector now matches the original instruction sequence except
for unresolved relocations with platform-tools v1.43, and passes 1,215 local
differential cases. Recovered quote-mint routing additionally passes 9,428 original-program
queries, but its compiled instructions still differ. Six Fees handlers pass 11,233 independent SBF comparisons; four recovered Pump
admin handlers pass 93 comparisons. Ten PumpSwap handlers pass 9,311 comparisons,
and twelve Mayhem handlers pass 1,357. These 21,994 SBF cases cover only the listed
32 handlers, not the complete programs. A separate native arithmetic fragment
matches reserve deltas from 160 successful original Pump sell transactions. See [the recovery experiment](docs/FEE_SELECTION.md).

[Recovery status](docs/RECOVERY.md) separates observed evidence from unresolved work.
[Tooling](docs/TOOLING.md) covers recapture, disassembly and strict candidate comparison.
The [security assessment](audit/AUDIT.md) remains incomplete. Local validation
includes 393 malformed-input checks and 30 signed offline lifecycle transactions;
these bounded checks do not establish full security or differential coverage.
Zero confirmed findings does not establish security.

The SPL Token dependency now has a fresh Linux source build matching the entire
captured 108,600-byte payload. [Build evidence](repro/pump/verified-spl-token/README.md)
is separate from the still-unmatched four Pump.fun programs.

Original bytes live under `evidence/`, never as rebuilt artifacts. This project
contains no on-chain deployment or transaction-broadcast tooling; the imported
signed test harness submits only to offline loopback simulators. Upstream IDLs retain their
original authorship; this repository does not assert a license over Pump's materials.

The [integrated research lab](research/README.md) supplies pinned Pump.fun lifecycle
fixtures, signed offline replay harnesses, receipt verifiers and an explicitly
incomplete 31-handler Fees scaffold. Its import provenance and validation status
are separate from source-reconstruction claims.
