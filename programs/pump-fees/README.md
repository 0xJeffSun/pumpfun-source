# Partial Pump Fees reconstruction

Two handlers execute recovered behavior: `get_fees` and
`get_fees_with_quote_mint`. The other 29 instruction bodies remain unsupported;
their generated account declarations are not recovered constraints. This crate
is an experimental reconstruction target, not a deployable substitute.

The interface scaffold originated in `research/imported-lab/reconstruction/pump-fun-fees-candidate`
(source commit and unchanged upstream hashes in `research/import-manifest.json`).
This working copy adds actual query implementations, PDA constraints using the
stored bump, optional trailing bool parsing, and the custom FeeConfig parser.
Original program bytes are comparison inputs only and never compiler inputs.

Observed parser rules: wrong discriminator or allocation below 2,512 bytes returns
InvalidAccountData; malformed vector serialization returns BorshIoError. Standard
Anchor ownership and initialization checks run before deserialization, followed by
the config-program PDA constraint. These are tested recovered rules, not a claim
that every account migration/version path has been recovered.

Anchor 0.30.1 gave the wrong short-discriminator error (100 rather than original
101); 0.31.1 matches that behavior. Cargo.lock pins the selected dependency graph,
which is not established as the historical graph. The full candidate still differs
substantially from the original binary. The experimental standalone fragments in
`recovered/` are separate compiler experiments; the crate builds `src/`.

```sh
python scripts/build_partial_candidate.py --manifest programs/pump-fees/Cargo.toml \
  --program pump_fees --artifact-name pump_fees_candidate.so \
  --output work/fees-clean-build
python scripts/validate_fee_handlers.py \
  --candidate work/fees-clean-build/artifacts/pump_fees_candidate.so \
  --output work/fees-handler-validation.json
```

Use a Python environment with root requirements installed and cargo-build-sbf
2.1.21 with platform-tools v1.52 available. Build offline from the pinned lockfile;
source/toolchain/build-log hashes and the raw full-file comparison are retained.
The runtime comparison checks return bytes, error codes, and unchanged account
state/lamports for queries. It does not assert log strings, compute usage, or byte
identity. Synthetic invalid account states are included and do not establish
reachability or a vulnerability.
